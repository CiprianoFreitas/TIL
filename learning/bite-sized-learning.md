# Bite sized learning

I've been struggling with the concept of learning for a long time. 

On one hand, I like learning new things \(whether they are directly related to my job or not\), on the other sometimes all that time I spent learning something feels wasted because I don't apply the knowledge which leads to me forgetting about it eventually. Recently I've been adhering to on-demand/just-in-time learning which allows me to learn new skills only when I need them after reading [Kurt Varner's post](https://medium.com/@kurtvarner/just-in-time-learning-fde2a8da4538) about it. 

There's also [this HBR article](https://hbr.org/2019/06/you-learn-best-when-you-learn-less) about learning in bite sized lengths which is a perfect addition to on-demand learning.
